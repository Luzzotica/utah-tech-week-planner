We know which questions to ask, the challenges you should anticipate, and how to avoid common pitfalls that may derail new products.\n\nWe promise this isn\u2019t a timeshare sales pitch \u2014 our goal is to support those creating new products as a way to give back to Utah\u2019s tech community. This is your chance to: \n\n1. Understand what kind of budget you should anticipate for your product.\n2. Learn how to define project requirements.\n3. Figure out what to do next, which could range anywhere from further researching your target market to hiring an experienced CTO.\n4. Get tips for hiring: Freelancers, agencies, and full-time employees all have their time and place, and we have extensive experience with all of them. We can guide you in the right direction and share some red flags to watch for. \n\nSpots are limited, so apply now to reserve your seat at the table. Come prepared to ask questions, bounce ideas around, and leave with actionable next steps.\n\nThis event is perfect for:\n\n1. Business leaders ready to turn innovative ideas into viable apps or websites.\n2. Aspiring tech entrepreneurs with product ideas but no development experience.\n3. Founders and startup teams looking to understand the costs and processes behind tech products. \n4. Anyone new to the tech industry looking for insights from experienced professionals.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in building a new product but aren\u2019t sure where to start, this is a must-attend event for Utah Tech Week.",

    "description": "For B2B startups, landing large corporate clients is an excellent anchor for revenue as well as demonstration of credibility to their market. At the same time, these are the most complicated customers to land, requiring the startup to identify and build key relationships; navigate the morass of procurement offices, vendor risk reviews, complex stakeholder incentives and approval processes; understand the current internal dynamics of the target client (both as they are and as the client perceives them); negotiate complex contracts and more. It's tough; but it is doable.  \n\nDrew Brown has been through this extensively on both sides of the table. Before recently relocating back to Utah, Drew was the Chief Information Officer for Union Bank and Trust, a $55B bank, managing millions of dollars in technology purchases and negotiations every year. Prior to that, Drew spent ten years advising the CIOs and their peers at publicly traded companies on a host of strategic issues, including many complex technology selection, negotiation, and acquisition projects. On the other side of the table, Drew has built two consulting practices (in AI/ML and technology strategy) and has sold millions of dollars in software and services to large corporate clients. \n\nCome hear Drew share insights on positioning your product, understanding how these buyers think (and where you can fit in), navigating the corporate mazes, and establishing the credibility that your startup needs to win the deal. Drew will share common tactics he has seen startups use that work, frequently observed mistakes, insights into some of the hard realities, and a few fun anecdotes as well. You can do this, and Drew will help you learn how. ",
